## Simple Lexical Analyser
This program showcases a simple lexical analyser that recognises a simple mathematical expression and outputs the tokens from it.

## How to run
You should run the `compile.bat` file to compile the program and generate the `simpleLexicalAnalyser.exe` executable file which you can run directly.

**NB:** If you make any changes to any of the `Lexer.h`, `Lexer.cpp` or `main.cpp` files, you have to run the `compile.bat` file in order to produce a new executable file(`simpleLexicalAnalyser.exe`) with your changes.

## Requirements
You should have the c++ compiler (`g++.exe`) in order to compile this program. The folder containing `g++.exe` compiler should be in your Environment Variables.
